This project was created to develop a _multi-platform desktop application_ for the **BrightScript Simulation Engine**, please visit the engine library repository and know all about the project history, features and limitations: http://github.com/lvcabral/brs-engine

The objective of this application is to extend the `brs-engine`, making it a full Roku device simulator, providing features such as:

- Web Installer (default port 80), allowing deploy of side-loaded apps and screenshots.
- ECP Service (default port 8060), that allows automation and data integration with external applications.
- ECP-2 Service (WebSockets), supporting the Roku mobile application to control the simulator.
- Telnet Server (port 8085), enabling remote Debugging.
- Customization of display, device model and information, controls and localization.

This way, the desktop simulator can be detected and handled by the [VS Code BrightScript Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RokuCommunity.brightscript), and other development tools, as a real Roku device, for deploy and debugging. You can find the installers for this desktop application (for all platforms) at this repository [Releases](https://github.com/lvcabral/brs-desktop/releases) page.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Since version 2.0.0, the simulator can execute code compatible with Roku OS 15 and includes experimental **SceneGraph** support which is currently in **alpha stage**.
>
>**Please be aware of the following:**
>
>- SceneGraph components may not render correctly
>- Some SceneGraph features are not yet implemented
>- Apps may crash or behave unexpectedly
>- Check all [current limitations](https://github.com/lvcabral/brs-engine/blob/scenegraph/docs/limitations.md) for more details
